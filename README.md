#Overview of Analysis

Purpose of new analysis is to present newly cleaned data with specific interest in numbers pretaining to averages of cost for trips as well as averages of earnings for drivers. This allows the data to be more easily understandable when trying to pinpoint specific information for cost analysis purposes. Date ranges also can provide insight to peak periods of earnings & trends. 

#Results of Analysis 

On average - the analysis provides a clear picture of costs per trips increase the further away you get from the urban areas. This is interrelated to the lack of drivers in suburban & rural areas. Traffic of trips however does increase substantially as you get closer towards the urban areas. With more drivers in the urban areas however, earnings potential from drivers' perspective is less.

#Summary

Business recommendations goes as follows - if the company earns percentages off the top of fares, urban areas are highly more profitable in regards to the amount of trips being taken on a month-to-month basis. There is a large potential to earn in the rural areas as well - this is provided to us by the data of earnings from the rural cities. Trips more often then not cost more as there is a lack of drivers & though traffic may be low - if they earn a portion of the top - the earnings potential is nonetheless quite tempting. Last recommendation is during peak periods of trips - drivers should charage a "surcharge" in order to increase profits from the drivers' side as well as the companies side. The amount of trips may decrease - but earnings potentail is still quite high.
